### Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you! I am Oleksandr. I am from 🇺🇦Odesa, Ukraine.

My job equals to my passion. I love WordPress and ☁️AWS.

I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate. I work at the best place to work [glomex](https://www.glomex.com) where I try to do my magic daily.

Usually I do some: 

- WP development
- infra operations (including IaC with Terraform and minor architecting)
- some DevOps
- some prompt engineering
- learning

Please do me a favor and check out my [Credly](https://www.credly.com/users/oleksandr-yarosh.a5a4f074/badges) profile.
