### Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you! I am Oleksandr. I am from 🇺🇦Odesa, Ukraine.

My job equals to my passion. I love WordPress and ☁️AWS.

I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate. I work at the best place to work [glomex](https://www.glomex.com) where I try to do my magic daily.

Usually I do some: WP development, infra operations (including IaC with Terraform and minor architecting), some DevOps, some prompt engineering.

There is a fun thing to check out about me:

I mostly work in private repos, thus the stats may be inaccurate.
